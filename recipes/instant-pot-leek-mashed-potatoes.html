    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A little something different from traditional mashed potatoes, for the Instant
      Pot. The leeks add a very mild oniony flavor. Enjoy!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
    <li>1 leek, white parts only, quartered lengthwise and finely sliced</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon coarse salt</li>
    <li>water to cover</li>
    <li>⅓ cup milk, warmed</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Combine potatoes, leek, and salt in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such
      as Instant Pot). Add water to cover, about 2 cups. Close and lock the lid.
      Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for
      10 minutes. Allow about 10 minutes for pressure to build.
    </li>
    <li>
      Release pressure using the natural-release method according to
      manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Carefully release remaining
      pressure using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove
      the lid. Drain potatoes well and return them to the pot.
    </li>
    <li>
      Select Saute function. Toss potatoes until dried and starting to sizzle,
      about 3 minutes. Add butter; stir until melted. Add milk. Mash potatoes with
      the back of a wooden spoon for a rustic mash, or run them through a ricer
      for a smoother mash. Taste and adjust the salt.
    </li>
  </ol>
